# Agar.io

This progam will become a Java version of the online game Agar.io. This repository contains files for the frame, game, points, and blobs in the game.

I work on this game in my free time between running in school, but it's still a work in progress and far from done. 

This version includes most of the mechanics of the game. In later versions, networking will be added for a multiplayer version.
